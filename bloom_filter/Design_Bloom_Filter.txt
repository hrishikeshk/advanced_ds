PURPOSE :
This document describes the design and implementation of a bloom filter. TODO.
Introduction :

Dependencies :
	1/ It is optional to use std::vector<> available with the Boost Library. Standard Library vector can be used too without side effects. Note that the objects can be deleted from the Tree but the container cannot be modified in any way that alters the offsets of remnant elements.
	2/ Tested on CentOS Linux 64-bit OS, gcc 4.4.7, but this should work
elsewhere
	3/ Requires Boost library ver 1.41.0 (For building unit tests only).
