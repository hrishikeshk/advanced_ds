advanced_ds
===========

This is an effort towards creating a collection of advanced data structures having utility in multiple applications.

Most of these data structures are not readily available in standard libraries or at least, there is some aspect of their implementation that this project offers anew or differently.

Planning to implement structures such as : Offset based RB-Trees, Binomial / Fibonacci heaps, Hash / Bloom Filters, B-Trees, Tries, Splay Trees etc. I will try to benchmark and provide sample usages too.
