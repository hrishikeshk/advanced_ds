advanced_ds
===========

This is an effort towards creating a collection of advanced data structures having utility in multiple applications.

Most of these data structures are not readily available in standard libraries, or at the very least, there is some aspect of their implementation that this project offers anew or differently. Therefore, even if a red-Black Tree has been implemented, and it is already widely available in standard library offerings, my Red-Black tree requires a different usage and manages data and memory allocation differently. I hope to use these structures in my own projects.

Planning to implement structures such as : Offset based, augmentation enabled RB-Trees, Binomial / Fibonacci heaps, Hash / Bloom Filters, B-Trees, Tries, Splay, Suffix, Segment Trees etc. I will try to benchmark and provide sample usages too.
